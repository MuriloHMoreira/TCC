@article{Ortega1997,
abstract = {The use of theoretical models of particle size distribution to maximise the packing density of a powder may result in significant improvement of the rheological behaviour of suspensions and compact's green density. In this work, Alfred and Andreasen models were studied, taking into account their effect on the characteristics of compacts obtained by uniaxial and isostatic pressing and by slip casting. It was noticed that although the Alfred model is considered more realistic than the Andreasen model, it has led to less dense and less homogeneous compacts in the samples obtained by slip casting. This behaviour, which hasn't been noticed in samples obtained by dry pressing, was attributed to the pore structure of the compacts, which allowed water flow to drag fine particles. In samples obtained according to the Andreasen model, that was not observed.},
