abstract = {The use of theoretical models of particle size distribution to maximise the packing density of a powder may result in significant improvement of the rheological behaviour of suspensions and compact's green density. In this work, Alfred and Andreasen models were studied, taking into account their effect on the characteristics of compacts obtained by uniaxial and isostatic pressing and by slip casting. It was noticed that although the Alfred model is considered more realistic than the Andreasen model, it has led to less dense and less homogeneous compacts in the samples obtained by slip casting. This behaviour, which hasn't been noticed in samples obtained by dry pressing, was attributed to the pore structure of the compacts, which allowed water flow to drag fine particles. In samples obtained according to the Andreasen model, that was not observed.},

@article{Flues2015,
abstract = {The iron and steel industry has some of the highest levels of carbon emissions and energy consumption in Europe. At the same time, this sector is of great economic importance for the European Union. In this paper we investigate the technological, market and policy factors that are associated with a reduction in the specific energy consumption in iron and steel production. In addition, we analyze whether achieving more environmentally friendly production is accompanied by a decrease or an increase in production levels. We base our analysis on technical information about cost factors of steel production routes, historical data for prices of energy carriers, on prices for the feedstock in the iron and steel sector, on political framework conditions, and the demand for steel. As we find out, higher energy prices tend to raise energy efficiency (or tend to reduce specific energy consumption) in the steel sector. Yet, because lower specific energy consumption is related to higher total steel production, energy price increases might cause a kind of rebound effect, bringing about an increase in total production as a consequence of induced energy efficiency improvements. Taking this effect into account, the negative relation between input prices and total steel production is not very strong. In the short run, the wages of employees in the steel sector tend to have the biggest influence on total steel production. In the long run, GDP and investment climate exert the biggest influence.},

Existence of the time-discrete solution in two dimensions is established using the theory of pseudomonotone operators in Banach spaces. Next, the spatial discretization is accomplished by the conforming finite element method. An illustrative numerical example shows that the model reproduces well the rapid increase of pore pressure in wet concrete due to extreme heating. Such phenomenon is of particular interest for the safety assessment of concrete structures prone to thermally-induced spalling. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Furnace walls and bottoms frequently consist of a refractory concrete, which has to be replaced from time to time due to abrasion. After relining, the furnace has to reach its operating temperature again. During this heat-up process, there is a risk of explosive spalling caused by the pore pressure build-up inside the wet concrete. These explosions may be very dangerous to the crew and the furnace-site. Those risks are reduced till today by the aid of empirically developed heat-up instructions (heat-up curves). The application of these curves doesn't really prevent explosive spalling and it is very time-consuming. To improve the first heat-up procedure, the empirically developed heat-up curves are replaced by optimized ones developed by the aid of numerical modeling. These curves are characterized by a constant maximum pressure during the heat-up drying period, and they bring a significant reduction of both, the heat-up time and the maximum pressure inside the concrete. Furthermore their dependency on wall thickness and pressure limit is investigated, as well as effects of previously not expected conditions which can occure during the heat-up of concrete under industrial conditions. Additionally, an optimized heat-up curve is used to dry a concrete brick in a laboratory experiment showing the practical applicability. Good agreement is obtained for the predicted pressure and temperature devolutions and the measured ones.},

abstract = {The first heat-up of furnaces consisting of wet refractory concrete is a challenge due to the pore pressure build-up which can exceed the strength of the concrete. To extend understanding of the complex heat and mass transfer phenomena taking place during the first heat-up, two reproducible heat-up experiments are carried out. These are performed by using a new developed pore pressure sensor. The experiments exhibit an intense change of concrete's thermal conductivity during the process. Further, even in case of one sided heating, two drying fronts are found to occur. In addition to the experimental investigation the first heat-up is simulated using a physical model, based on the coupled balances of energy and the masses of liquid water, water vapour and air as well. By the aid of numerical simulation the first heat-up is further investigated and mass flow behaviour of air, vapour and liquid water is discussed. Within the scope of a sensitivity study the concrete's thermal conductivity and it's permeability are obtained as it's most important material properties and they are used for calibration of the model aiming well representation of the experimental data. The adjusted material properties are found to be in good agreement with refractory concrete properties reported in literature.},

abstract = {A general approach to modelling chemical degradation processes in building materials, due to combined action of variable hydro-thermal, chemical and mechanical loads, is presented. Mechanics of multiphase porous media and damage mechanics are applied for this purpose, and kinetics of degradation processes is described with evolution equations based on thermodynamics of chemical reactions. The mass-, energy -and momentum balances, as well as the evolution equations, constitutive and physical relations are briefly summarized. Then, the model governing equations are numerically solved with the finite element method. Three examples of the model application for analyzing degradation processes of building materials are presented and discussed. The first one deals with capillary suction of the salt solution by two different building materials, the second one with the salt crystallization during drying of a brick wall, and the third one concerns calcium leaching from a concrete wall due to the chemical attack of pure water under pressure gradient at two different temperatures.},

abstract = {A constitutive model for the analysis of deformations of concrete subject to transient temperature and pressures is proposed. In these severe conditions concrete structures experience spalling phenomenon, which is the violent or non-violent breaking off of layers or pieces of concrete from the surface of a structural element when it is exposed to high and rapidly rising temperatures. This process can lead to a loss of load-bearing capacity, trough a loss of section and a loss of protection to steel reinforcement. Many different form of spalling exist, but probably the most dangerous is explosive spalling, because it is sudden and capable to result in a general collapse of the structure. The constitutive model includes thermo-chemical and mechanical damage for taking into account the deterioration of the material due to mechanical loads, high temperatures and chemical changes and it is introduced into a general coupled mathematical model of hygro-thermo-chemomechanical behaviour of concrete structures. In this constitutive model the so called free thermal strains, which are the concrete strains during first heating, are decomposed in three main contributions: thermal dilatation strains (treated in a manner usual in thermomechanics), shrinkage strains (modelled by means of the effective stress principle) and thermo-chemical strains (which take into account for the thermo-chemical decomposition of the concrete and which are related to thermo-chemical damage). Thermo-mechanical strains occurring during first heating of concrete under load, known as LITS (Load Induced Thermal Strains), are also included in the framework of thermodynamics of porous media. The proposed model is applied to an illustrative example that demonstrates its capabilities.},

abstract = {The paper deals with modelling of hygro-thermal performance and thermo-chemical degradation of concrete exposed to high temperature. Several possible simplifications in modelling of heat and mass transport phenomena in heated concrete are considered and their effect on the results of numerical simulations is analyzed. A mathematical model of concrete at high temperature, already extensively validated with respect to experiments, is used as the reference model. It is based on mechanics of multiphase porous media and considers all important couplings and material nonlinearities, as well as different properties of water above the critical point of water, i.e. 647.3 K (374.15 ??C). In this part of the paper, first physical phenomena, as well as heat and mass flux and sources in a concrete element are studied, both during slow and fast heating process, to examine the relative importance of different flux components. Then, the mathematical model of concrete at high temperature, developed by Authors in the last 10 years, is briefly presented and for the first time all the constitutive relationships of the model are summarized and discussed in detail. Finally, the method of numerical solution of the model equations is thoroughly presented. In the companion paper (part II) a brief literature review of the existing mathematical models of concrete at high temperature and a summary of their main features and physical assumptions will be presented. Then, extensive numerical studies will be performed with several simplified models, neglecting chosen physical phenomenon or flux components, to evaluate the difference between the results obtained with the simplified models and with the reference model. The study will concern hygric, thermal and degradation performance of 1-D and 2-D axisymmetric concrete elements during fast and slow heating. The analysis will allow us to indicate which simplifications in modeling of concrete at high temperature are practically and physically possible, without generating excessive errors with respect to the full reference model. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
