@article{Ortega1997,
abstract = {The use of theoretical models of particle size distribution to maximise the packing density of a powder may result in significant improvement of the rheological behaviour of suspensions and compact's green density. In this work, Alfred and Andreasen models were studied, taking into account their effect on the characteristics of compacts obtained by uniaxial and isostatic pressing and by slip casting. It was noticed that although the Alfred model is considered more realistic than the Andreasen model, it has led to less dense and less homogeneous compacts in the samples obtained by slip casting. This behaviour, which hasn't been noticed in samples obtained by dry pressing, was attributed to the pore structure of the compacts, which allowed water flow to drag fine particles. In samples obtained according to the Andreasen model, that was not observed.},

abstract = {The use of steel in the production of rolled necessary to any economy has determined a continuous increase of production. In the context in which this metal has become a foundation for the entire world, the steel production can be considered an important economic indicator in the analysis regarding the performance of a company. The purpose of this work is to analyze the trend of the crude steel production and the correlation between this and the economic growth. The data used were reported to a set of six countries for the period 1991 to 2011. The results obtained demonstrate the fact that the economic growth rate infl uence the production of crude steel, but in diff erent proportions from a country to another.},

@article{Flues2015,
abstract = {The iron and steel industry has some of the highest levels of carbon emissions and energy consumption in Europe. At the same time, this sector is of great economic importance for the European Union. In this paper we investigate the technological, market and policy factors that are associated with a reduction in the specific energy consumption in iron and steel production. In addition, we analyze whether achieving more environmentally friendly production is accompanied by a decrease or an increase in production levels. We base our analysis on technical information about cost factors of steel production routes, historical data for prices of energy carriers, on prices for the feedstock in the iron and steel sector, on political framework conditions, and the demand for steel. As we find out, higher energy prices tend to raise energy efficiency (or tend to reduce specific energy consumption) in the steel sector. Yet, because lower specific energy consumption is related to higher total steel production, energy price increases might cause a kind of rebound effect, bringing about an increase in total production as a consequence of induced energy efficiency improvements. Taking this effect into account, the negative relation between input prices and total steel production is not very strong. In the short run, the wages of employees in the steel sector tend to have the biggest influence on total steel production. In the long run, GDP and investment climate exert the biggest influence.},
